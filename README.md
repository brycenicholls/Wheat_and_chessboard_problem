# Wheat_and_chessboard_problem

Program that prints how many grains of rice there are on each square,and print the total amount of wheat on the chessboard.
    
 If/when the numbers become very large, you should switch to a larger unit when printing the number. 
 
 Use the following:
 
       * 1kg = 50,000 grains
       * 1 ton = 1000 kg
       * Titanic = 52000 tons
       * The Empire State Building weights 365000 tons
       * Hoover Dam: 6.6 million tons
       * 1 cubic km == 1,000,000,000 tons
       * Total Coal reserves in China (2009) = 1.73bn Tons
